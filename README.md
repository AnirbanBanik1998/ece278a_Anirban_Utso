The content of this class relies on the following excellent resources:
- Slides from B. S. Manjunath from previous years of ECE 278A.
- Textbook [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://szeliski.org/Book/), by [Richard Sweliski](http://szeliski.org/RichardSzeliski.htm).
- Google Slides by [Steve Seitz](https://www.smseitz.com/).
- [Brown, M. S. (2019). ICCV 2019 tutorial on understanding color and the in-camera image processing pipeline for computer vision.](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~mbrown/ICCV19_Tutorial_MSBrown.pdf)
